# Clean Framework

Clean Framework is a Node.js framework designed to provide developers with a clean and structured way to build scalable and maintainable backend applications. With Clean Framework, you can quickly set up your project, define your API routes, and start building your business logic without worrying about boilerplate code.

## Features

- Robust architecture for building scalable and maintainable backend applications
- Built-in support for routing, middleware, and authentication
- Modular structure for easy integration of third-party libraries
- Support for MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL databases
- Built-in error handling and logging

## Installation

```bash
npm install clean-framework
```

## Getting Started

To create a new Clean Framework project, run the following command:

```bash
npx clean-framework create-project <project-name>
```

This will create a new project in the specified directory with a basic project structure and configuration files.

## Usage
